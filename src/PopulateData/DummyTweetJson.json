Berries, apples, cucumbers and tomatoes are the worst because some people eat the skin. This explains why the virus is spreading faster in the west than asia. Most Asians do not eat salad and very few people eat the skin of any fruit. We have to assume anything that comes from outside our home within 48 hours is infected.
